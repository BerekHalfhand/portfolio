                My first commercial project worth mentioning I completed when I was still a student,
                it was a real-time monitoring system for a gold mine in Siberia.
                The system received data about energy consumption from the industrial
                pumps, processed, stored and displayed it via web-interface.
                After that I did some part-time freelance at times, being busy graduating.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having finished that I got employed by Tile.Expert. There I built
                an internal <a href="https://te.remote.team/#/">web portal</a> for the companyâ€™s employees,
                it was built on Angular / Symfony / MongoDB stack. The project was hard by many reasons,
                and it gave me tons of experience developing and supporting a large real-world project.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the meantime, I explored new technologies and methods to keep my skills
                up to date, such as React, Vue, and Ruby on Rails. Now I'm hoping to put
                the new skills to good use, but good ol' Angular is fine, too.
