                My first commercial project worth mentioning I completed when I was still a student,
                it was a real-time monitoring system for a gold mine in Siberia.
                The system received energy consumption data from the industrial
                pumps, then processed, stored and displayed it via web-interface.
                After that I did some part-time freelance at times, being busy graduating.

                Having finished that I got employed by Tile.Expert. There I built
                an internal <a href="https://te.remote.team/#/">web portal</a> for the companyâ€™s employees.
                The project was hard by many reasons, and it gave me tons of experience
                developing, refactoring, and supporting a large real-world application.
              </p>

                In the meantime, I explored new technologies and methods to keep my skills
                up to date, such as React, Vue, and Ruby on Rails. This portfoilio web app is a serverless
                WPA built on Angular7. It is still a work <a href="https://github.com/BerekHalfhand/portfolio">in progress</a>,
                so it can be a bit rough around the edges and kinda slow, but it gets better every day.

                The latest project of mine is a mobile app built with React Native, released in just 3 weeks
                after I started to work on it without previous exprerience with React Native. It features
                things like biometry authentication and online payments, and rest assured there's more to come!
