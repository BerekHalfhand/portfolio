              I completed my first commercial project when I was still a student,
              it was a real-time monitoring system for a gold mine in Siberia.
              The system received data about energy comsumption from the industrial
              pumps, processed, stored and displayed it via web-interface.
              After that I did some part-time freelance at times, being busy graduating.

              Having finished that I got employed by Tile.Expert. There I built
              an internal web portal for the companyâ€™s employees, it was built on
              Angular / Symfony / MongoDB stack. The project was hard by many reasons,
              and it gave me tons of experience developing and supporting a large real-world project.
