            I'm Yuri Drobkov, a digital nomad from Siberia, Russia. My path as a web
            developer started when responsive design was an exciting new concept and
            LAMP stack was considered a feasible option for building huge complex websites.
            These days things are different, the industry is growing more vast and
            complicated by the day, cool kids are using Angular,
            React, Ruby on Rails, you name it...
            And me? I'm just trying to keep up with the unvawering march of time and
            maybe stay just ahead of the crowds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most recent commercial project I participated in was an internal
            <a href="https://te.remote.team/">web portal</a> for the employees of
            <a href="https://tile.expert/">Tile.Expert</a>, it was built on
            Angular/Symfony/MongoDB stack. It was my first remote job, which gave me
            tons of experience in developing and supporting a large real-world project.
            Now I'm on the lookup for the next one...
          </p>
          <p>Care to make a suggestion?</p>
